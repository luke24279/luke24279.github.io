    <h1>Luke Thompson</h1>
    <p>My name is Luke Thompson, and this is my Three JS portfolio.</p>
    <p>To the left are my three certificates I have obtained throughout my high school and college career. So far, I
      have three certificates: OSHA 10-Hour General Industry Course, CompTIA ITF+, and CIW JavaScript Specialist.</p>
    <p>As of the year 2023, I have experience in a job working for CPYSL, a soccer league where I work to referee
      matches. I have been working since 2020 at this job, which adds up to four years. This job has helped to improve
      my communication skills with other people and handle rough situations where I am beinging watched, under pressure,
      and having to make the right decision even if people may not like it.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>OSHA Certificate:</h1>
    <p>In my junior year of high school, my programming class completed a 10 hour OSHA course for another certificate to
      help us in the future. This course went over the basics of working in a safe environment, such as knowing which
      fire extinguisher put out which type of fire.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>ITF Certificate</h1>
    <p>My programming class also had us study for and take the CompTIA ITF+ test for its respective certificate. We
      spent weeks studying a practice version of the test, which really helped as most of the test consisted of IT
      topics outside of programming, such as Networking and Hardware. Despite me not knowing most of it at the start, I
      studied and studied and mananaged to obtain the certificate which will really help my career out in the future.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>CIW Certificate</h1>
    <p>The third certificate I have is the CIW: JavaScript Specialist certification. This certificate assures any
      employer that I have understand how to program with JavaScript and a bit of HTML and CSS, as they work hand in
      hand. This course, similar to OSHA's 10 hour long course, took quite some time. With about 14 chapters to do, each
      with plenty of reading, labs, and questions scattered about, it took our class awhile to complete.</p>
