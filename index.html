    <h1>Luke Thompson</h1>
    <p>My name is Luke Thompson, and this is my Three JS portfolio.</p>
    <p>To the left are my three certificates I have obtained throughout my high school and college career. So far, I
      have three certificates: OSHA 10-Hour General Industry Course, CompTIA ITF+, and CIW JavaScript Specialist.</p>
    <p>As of the year 2023, I have experience in a job working for CPYSL, a soccer league where I work to referee
      matches. I have been working since 2020 at this job, which adds up to four years. This job has helped to improve
      my communication skills with other people and handle rough situations where I am beinging watched, under pressure,
      and having to make the right decision even if people may not like it.</p>
