    <h1>Luke Thompson</h1>
    <p>My name is Luke Thompson, and this is my Three JS portfolio.</p>
    <p>To the left are my three certificates I have obtained throughout my high school and college career. So far, I
      have two certificates: OSHA 10-Hour General Industry Course, CompTIA ITF+, but I am currently seeking out my CIW
      JavaScript Specialist certificate.</p>
    <p>As of the year 2023, I have experience in a job working for CPYSL, a soccer league where I work to referee
      matches. I have been working since 2020 at this job, which adds up to four years. This job has helped to improve
      my communication skills with other people and handle rough situations where I am being watched, under pressure,
      and having to make the right decision even if people may not like it.</p>

    <h1>Formbar</h1>
    <p>In my trade high school, I am currently working on a project in my programming class to make an online website
      that can create and control classes, creates polls for the students to answer, and manage the school entirely.
      This web page will be a breakthrough for my school, as it will simplify everything teachers do in class. Now,
      students can push one button and it will notify the teacher that they need help. This will optimize the efficiency
      of classes without needing to stop the class when learning.</p>
